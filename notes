make footer that fits page aesthetic - no slanted stuff just socials and email and etc
redo the review carousel to look modern and move slowly unless manually operated - should have arrows that when pressed stops moving auto and start moving manually

put everything together in the contact section. doesnt need to be divided
review carousel should be circular list and should be clicked on if someone wants to read full thing, so only some ni of words are allowed and user clicks to read full thing and carousel stull works in preview mode

redesign video gallery to actually look like a modern video gallery with lightbox and dope controls. use the videos folder for video material


use fontawesome for icons instead of drawing them manually
<i class="fa-brands fa-whatsapp"></i>
<i class="fa-solid fa-phone"></i>
<i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i>
<i class="fa-brands fa-tiktok"></i>


move guest review section before video section. 
for the reviews make the cards look like note sheets. just give review aesthetic formatting the names of reviewers and dates nicely especially in full review view but maintain structure. 


make the transition between the sections smoother. rn its doing some invisible section appear out of no where irregularly thing. it should be smooth and consistent. also spaces between sections should be good enough - not too long. all this is verticla btw
